Although I'm just a beginner, I enjoy a lot writing code for data analysis, visualization and stuff that makes my life easier. I'm a R lover, but eager to learn pretty much anything data-related.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I'm addicted to sports, especially football (the <strong>real</strong> one, not the handegg's) and basketball. Love hanging out with my friends and family, getting into useless debates and learning new things!
