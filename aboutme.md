Although I'm just a beginner, I enjoy a lot writing code for data analysis, visualization and stuff that makes my life easier. I'm a R lover, but eager to learn pretty much anything data-related.

I'm addicted to sports, especially <strong>football</strong> (the real one, not handegg) and basketball. Love hanging out with my friends and family, getting into useless debates and learning new things!
