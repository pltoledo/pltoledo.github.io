title: The 7 Basketball Roles
subtitle: A study of Basketball Positions using Cluster Analysis
---

![](/img/the-7-roles-of-basketball/baketball.jpg)<!-- -->

Since its foundation, basketball has been played with five positions: guard, shooting-guard, forward, power-forward and center. However, the game has changed a lot over the years, and even though this positions are still the reference, it evolved in a way that this classification is too shallow and do not represent the different playstyles and roles that exist today. So, a couple colleagues and I proposed a new approach to basketball positions, inspired by the analogous work of Stanford University student Muthu Alagappan, which you can find [here](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Alagappan-Muthu-EOSMarch2012PPT.pdf?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialmedia&utm_campaign=wiredplaybookclickthru). 

Our ideia was to use Cluster Analysis to group players based on the frequency they made certain types of plays, and treat each group as a different role they had in court. Below is the step-by-step process of defining this new roles, in which we used the R language. The code is commented and reproducible.

### Necessary Packages

These are the packages that need to be loaded for the analysis:

``` r
library(nbastatR) # Package for getting NBA data
library(tidyverse) # Package framework for data wrangling, manipulation and visualization
library(RColorBrewer) # Color pallettes
library(ggrepel) # Package for improving text visualization
library(broom) # Package for tidying models
library(patchwork) # Package for displaying multiple ggplot graphs in a grid
library(gghighlight) # Package for highlighting specific parts of a ggplot graph
library(colorspace) # Color pallettes
```

All packages can be installed using the `install.packages()` function,
except for nbastatR, in which case
`devtools::install_github("abresler/nbastatR")` should be used instead.

### Data import and manipulation

First, the data from the nbastatR API was collected. The active players
in the 2018-19 season were gathered on an initial data frame, along with
their general statistics and information (such as team, age, points, assits, etc). Then, the numeric statistics
were converted to per game measures and the position variable was
re-categorized so that each player was classified as either guard (G),
forward (F) or center (C). Finally, the players whose team variable was
missing were ruled out.

``` r
# Gather player's general data
roster <- seasons_rosters(2019, return_message = F) %>% 
  select(idTeam, slugTeam, idPlayer, groupPosition) %>% 
  rename(id_team = idTeam, team = slugTeam, pos = groupPosition)

players <- seasons_players(seasons = 2019, nest_data = F, return_message = F) %>% 
  select(idPlayer, namePlayer) 

general_stats <- teams_players_stats(seasons = 2019, 
                             types = 'player', 
                             tables = 'general', 
                             season_types = 'Regular Season', 
                             measures = 'Base', 
                             modes = 'Totals', 
                             defenses = 'Overall', 
                             assign_to_environment = F, 
                             return_message = F) %>% 
  unnest(cols = dataTable) %>% 
  select(idPlayer, agePlayer, slugTeam, idTeam,
         minutes, gp, wins, losses,
         fgm, fga, pctFG, 
         fg3m, fg3a, pctFG3,
         ftm, fta, pctFT,
         pts, ast, oreb, dreb, treb, blk, blka, stl, pf, tov)

data <- players %>% 
  left_join(general_stats, by = 'idPlayer')

# Transform variables
data2 <- data %>% 
  left_join(roster, by = 'idPlayer') %>% 
  mutate(slugTeam = ifelse(is.na(slugTeam), team, slugTeam),
         idTeam = ifelse(is.na(idTeam), id_team, idTeam)) %>% 
  select(idPlayer, namePlayer, pos, everything(), -team, -id_team) %>% 
  mutate(pos = case_when(pos == 'G-F' ~ 'G',
                         pos == 'F-G' ~ 'F',
                         pos == 'C-F' ~ 'C',
                         pos == 'F-C' ~ 'F',
                         TRUE ~ pos)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20:29), function(x) round(x/data$gp, digits = 2)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(slugTeam)) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, gtools::na.replace, replace = 0) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(minutes, pctFG3), round, digits = 3)
```

After this, the dataset was fed with the data that was going to be used
on the clustering, which consisted on certain plays frequencies (for example, isolation). The players that had all this variables missing were also ruled out of the analysis.

``` r
cluster_data1 <- data2
# Define a function to get the frequency data
get_freq_data <- function(df, category){
  data <- synergy(seasons = 2019, result_types = c("player"),
                  season_types = c("Regular Season"),
                  set_types = c("offensive"),
                  categories = c("Transition", 
                                 'Isolation', 
                                 'PRBallHandler', 
                                 "PRRollman", 
                                 'Postup',
                                 'SpotUp',
                                 'Handoff', 
                                 'Cut', 
                                 'OffScreen', 
                                 'OffRebound'),
                  assign_to_environment = F, 
                  nest_data = T,
                  return_message = F)
  varname <- ifelse(str_detect(category, '^Off.'), 
                    str_to_lower(str_c(str_extract(category, '^[A-Z]'), str_extract(category, '(?<=Off).'), '_freq')),
                    str_c(str_to_lower(str_sub(category, 1, 3)), '_freq'))
  res <- df %>% 
    left_join(data[which(data$categorySynergy == category),]$dataSynergy %>% 
                data.frame %>%  
                select(idPlayer, pctFrequency) %>% 
                rename(!!varname := pctFrequency), 
              by = 'idPlayer')
  return(res)
}

**Important Note**: in this kind of study, it's important to scale the variables before the analysis to make their values comparable. In this case, the variables didn't need to be scaled, all of them were already ranging between 0 and 1, as they represented relative frequencies.

### Clusters

With the data ready, we select only the players who participated in atleast 29 games in the season. Then, we proceeded with the cluster analysis using the K-means algotithm. We began fitting several models and analysing the elbow plot. 

``` r
model_df <- cluster_data_final %>% filter(gp > 29) %>% select(30:39) %>% mutate_all(round, digits = 3)

res <- data.frame(VARIAB = NA, CENTERS = NA)
set.seed(111)
for (i in 1:20){
  mod <- kmeans(model_df, centers = i, nstart = 50)
  res <- base::rbind(res, c(mod$tot.withinss, i))
}
res <- res %>% na.omit

ggplot(res, aes(x = CENTERS, y = VARIAB)) +  #Elbow Plot
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() 
```

![Elbow Plot](/img/the-7-roles-of-basketball/cluster-1.png)<!-- -->

It seemed reasonable to use 7 clusters. So then,
a final model with said number of groups was fitted:
``` r
set.seed(111)
clusters <- kmeans(model_df, centers = 7, nstart = 50)
```
### The 7 roles
After fitting the model, we made a complete analysis of each group, taking into consideration the average frequency of each play, aswell as the general statistics such as field goal attempts and 3-point percentage. We came up with the following roles:

* **Primary Ball Handler**: players that most control the ball, having the highest pick-and-roll as ball handler and isolation frequencies. They also are number one in assits and turnovers and second in points. Examples: Damian Lillard, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Luka Doncic.
* **Secondary Ball Handler**: players that have high pick-and-roll as ball handler and isolation rates, but still much lower then primary ball handlers. However they have high rates of spot ups, handoffs and offscreen oportunities. Generally speaking, they are players that can create their own shots, but can also play without the ball. They are number 3 in points and second in assists. Examples: Kevin Durant, Paul George, CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal.
* **Static Shooter**: players that have the highest spot up rates. They also have a lot of opportunities in transition, and low rates of hand offs and off screen oportunities. They have the lowest field goal attempts between all the roles, and more than a half of this attempts are three pointers. These players tend to be role players or complementary pieces. Examples: Danny Green, PJ Tucker.
* **Dynamic Shooter**: players that move a lot without the ball, and therefore have the highest off screen and hand offs oportunities. They've also got a few spot ups, but far less than static shooters. In general, they are players with the 3 point shot as the primary resource, being the role with the highest 3 point attempts and percentages, but, unlike the static shooters, they can shot on the move and create their own shots off the dribble. Examples: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, JJ Redick, Joe Harris, Kyle Jorver. 
* **Big Man Shooter**: players that have high rates of classic 'big man' plays, such as pick-and-roll as the rollman and post ups. However, what differs them from most bigs is the high frequency of spot ups (the second highest behind static shooter), as they shoot a lot from mid and long range. They are commonly reffered as 'Stretch Four' or 'Stretch Five'. Examples: Al Horford, Brook Lopez, DeMarcus Cousins, Draymond Green and Lauri Markannen.
* **Big Man Post Up**: players that have the highest post up rates, the most important trait of this role. Besides, they often do screens, fight for offensive rebounds and cut to the basket. Some of them are also known for their shooting prowess. They've got the second best field goal percentage, and are number one in points, rebounds and blocks. Examples: Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Karl-Anthony Towns, LaMarcus Aldridge, Nikola Jokic. Surprisingly, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ben Simmons are also in this group.
* **Big Man Rim Runner**: players that stand out in pick-and-rolls as the rollman, fight for offensive rebounds and do cuts to the basket, but have a low frequency of other plays. They are usually athletic centers, who pose an alley-oop threat. They are also second in rebounds and blocks. Examples: Clint Capela, DeAndre Jordan, Myles Turner, Rudy Gobert, Serge Ibaka.

With the roles defined, they were recategorized and bound to the original dataset:

``` r
# Bind clusters to original data frame
model_result <- augment(x = clusters, data = filter(cluster_data_final, gp > 29)) %>% 
  rename(cluster = .cluster) %>%
  mutate(cluster = case_when(cluster == 1 ~ 'Big Man Shooter',
                             cluster == 2 ~ 'Dynamic Shooter',
                             cluster == 3 ~ 'Primary Ball Handler',
                             cluster == 4 ~ 'Big Man Post Up',
                             cluster == 5 ~ 'Static Shooter',
                             cluster == 6 ~ 'Secondary Ball Handler',
                             cluster == 7 ~ 'Big Man Rim Runner'))
```

### Visualization

After fitting the model and analysing the clusters, we made a few graphs to visualize the
results. This is the spatial visualization of the roles,
achieved using PCA to get the two principal components that most explain
the variance:

``` r
# Color scales
cluster_colors <- qualitative_hcl(n = 7) # Customized colors for each role
names(cluster_colors) <- unique(model_result$cluster)
scale_fill_cluster <- scale_fill_manual(name = "Role", values = cluster_colors) 
scale_color_cluster <- scale_color_manual(name = "Role", values = cluster_colors) 

pos_colors <- brewer.pal(3, 'Set1') # Customized Colors for each position
names(pos_colors) <- unique(na.omit(model_result$pos))
scale_fill_pos <- scale_fill_manual(name = "Position", values = pos_colors, 
                                    labels = c('G'= 'Guard', 'F' = 'Forward', 'C' = 'Center'))

### Conclusion
Much can be achieved through data science, even in sports. This is only a tiny application of what can be done, and I hope in the future we can see more different and interesting works on this subject, not only in basketball, but also in football (soccer) and many other sports. It's time that we put tradition aside, and start taking a more data-related approach, which has the potential to bring great results.
